This is just a quick guide.

The variables that have to be set are:

ARDMK_DIR and ARDUINO_DIR. AVR_TOOLS_DIR is optional. If you use the default tools from the Arduino folder
you do not have to set this variable as the makefile will detect it. For windows you have to download:

Cygwin, and its tools: make, perl, python and the perl package Device::SerialPort.

You should also create a symbolic link for Arduino folder in case your default installation folder has either
spaces, or special characters such as, ( , etc. For creating the symbolic link you have to use the command
mklink on the windows command window.

The variables should be:

ARDMK_DIR=/cygdrive/c/Users/emga/Arduino-Makefile

ARDUINO_DIR=../../../../../Arduino

AVR_TOOLS_DIR=../../../../../Arduino/hardware/tools/avr

BOARD_TAG=mega2560

MONITOR_PORT=com3
